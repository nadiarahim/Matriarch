        <div class= main><p>A matriarch is a poised and powerful woman, who has assumed the role of leader and figurehead for her family or community. A matriarch has passed the day-to-day duties of strength feminism down to the next generation, and in turn has embraced the responsibility of providing wisdom, guidance, nurturing, and serving as a role model to her loved ones. Her age and experience have earned her the respect that she commands, and in turn, she acts as a pillar of strength for the women in her family that aspire to be like her. Women who assume the position of matriarch are reliable; they are wholly dedicated to the community that they support, and they provide a great deal of affection and comfort. They regard their family with the warm unconditional love of a mother, but at the same time, with the firm guidance of a leader.</p></div>

Her dad was not sure if he should put her in school because there weren’t many Bengalis at the time. But, her mom insisted and so she became one of the few people in the area to be able to speak both Farsi and Bengali. My grandmother carried the Farsi back with her to Bangladesh and later raised her kids to speak both languages. The dialect was passed down through generations and now to the point where you kids can read it.”</div>

                  <p class = "text">Hands are extensions of our bodies that act as the tools allowing us to perform the complex tasks that we need to get done. For a matriarch, this means that her hands are used as tools for nurturing, comforting, feeding, washing, teaching, and loving. A mother’s hands are faithfully dedicated to her upbringing. They are there to prepare a meal, to hold a hand, and to wipe away a tear if needed. An immigrant mother’s hands may be rough and weathered by years of hard work, but every imperfection and every fine line is evidence of the selfless love she feels for her family.
